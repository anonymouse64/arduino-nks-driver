This is the initial version of the Mathematica Arduino driver I developed at the Wolfram Science Summer School 2014.

Here is a link to the Wolfram Community blog post I wrote detailing this driver: http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/315748?p_p_auth=MsQ1wUxH

This version of the driver code has a few drawbacks, namely that it has the Arduino send data constantly to Mathematica, and Mathematica doesn't have a very efficient method of parsing the data.

This is simply a permanent place to store the files, the updated driver will be present in the next releast of Mathematica.

There is also a notebook file that I used at the Summer School for demoing the driver included here.
